# Hello, OpenGL
I'm trying out OpenGL, let's go

### Build
To build, you need to either:
- Use the provided Code::Blocks project
- Use g++ with -lopengl32, -lglu32 and -lgdi32 (This is a windows only project, might try it out on Linux at some point though)

### Sprites
The sprites you see are taken from Mario 64, because I can't load png files yet. The data is stored as "RGBA5551", the native format for N64.

### Why?
I was just bored, and I'm testing out some new stuff :)
